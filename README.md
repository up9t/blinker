## FAQ

### What’s the purpose?

This app is designed for people that looking at laptop or desktop for a long time, it help their eyes relax, and preventing or slowing the process of more nearsightedness. Blinking is good for eye’s health, but when we are too focus to do our jobs, we sometimes forget to blink, it sometimes also causes some headache if we’re focused for too long.

### Who are the targets?

Mainly for developers, but also for people that doing their job in front of computer.

### What are the platforms?

Mainly for desktop, it could be 

- Linux,
- Windows and
- macOS,

Again, I’m trying to help people that has the same problem as many as possible.
